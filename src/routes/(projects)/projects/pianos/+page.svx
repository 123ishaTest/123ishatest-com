## PianOS

When I worked at [Q42](https://www.q42.nl/) there was a yearly hackathon called the w00tcamp.
While hackathons normally focus on solving complex real-world problems overnight, the w00tcamp takes a much better approach.
Teams are encouraged to create something silly!
It's all about finding the perfect balance between _not too useful_ and _not too useless_.

I've always wanted to design my own game console, and creating it out of something as ridiculous as a piano seemed the perfect amount of silly.
We wired buttons under the keys which send input to a game emulator.

A bit of technology alongside beautiful woodworking means people can play Super Mario on a piano now!

#### Does it have games to help you study the piano?
Of course not, that would be too useful!

#### Does it still make sound when you play it?
Of course, otherwise it would be too useless!

We did create a _Simon Says_ type game that two people could play competitively.

The piano stands tall at the Q42 office, making guests do a double take: _"Wait, why does that piano have a screen?"_
