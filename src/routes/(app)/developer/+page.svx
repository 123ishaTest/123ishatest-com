  Hi, I'm Isha! I am a full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience.
  I'm currently working as a freelancer, building anything from full-stack database administration tools to open-source game engines and from robotics to mobile applications .

  After working for various companies, I grew frustrated with the pace they* operate with.
  Time is wasted by countless meetings, unreliable communication and pointless hierarchies.
  Shortcuts are taken and code quality is often not valued enough, leading to slowdowns years down the road.

  Having learned what to avoid, I focus on delivering high-quality software built on modern practices that will stand the test of time.

  <DeveloperSkills/>

  You will find in me an enthusiastic developer who gets their joy from seeing people interact with the systems they've built.
  Eager to deliver, I cannot wait to hear what we'll be building together!

  If want to hire me for your project <a href="#lets-chat">contact me</a> below!
