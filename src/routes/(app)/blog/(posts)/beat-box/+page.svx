## BeatBox

A long time ago I got inspired by a musical thing I saw at a festival.
It had tiles you could move on a grid to manipulate sounds.
When I realised it changed the background music, it blew my mind so badly that I forgot about it for the next 8 years.

Suddenly remembering, I decided to recreate it! In my mind it looked something like this

A camera scans the tiles through the glass and plays musical samples on a loop.
Users can place various tiles which sound good (or bad) together to create their own songs.

The placement of the tile matters! One axis controls the volume, while the other does a pitch shift.

If I ever get a decent microphone I will upload a video of it making sound, but for now these pictures will have to do!

And of course no project is done until it has LED lighting...
