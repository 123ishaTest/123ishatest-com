  Hi, my name Isha!
  I have been creating puzzles and games for over 10 years now.

  Incremental games are my specialty.
  There is something so satisfying about reducing a game to its core mechanics.
  If a game is not fun an incremental game, there is a large chance it is not that fun as a full-fledged game either.
  Over the years I have compiled all my code into a single game engine: <a href="https://ludiek.123ishatest.com" target="_blank" style="color: oklch(62% 0.194 149.214)">Ludiek</a>.

  I also work as a freelance game designer and developer.
  You can hire me to design your game and I guarantee it will end up more fun than it was before!

  Another big passion of mine is <a href={link}>Puzzles</a>.
  Hiding information in obscure ways and watching people figure it out is an amazing experience.
  I can make puzzles for any event or topic at any difficulty level!

  If want to hire me for your game, or commission a hand-crafted puzzle, <a href="#lets-chat">contact me</a> below!
